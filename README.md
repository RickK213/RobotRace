# ROBOT RACE
Welcome to Robot Race — a Javascript Dice Game.

How to Play:
1. This game is played with a set of 6 dice—d4, d6, d8, d10, d12 & d20.
2. The goal of the game is to be the first player to build their robot. Each robot has 6 pieces.
3. To begin the game, each player rolls the 6-sided die. The higher number goes first.
4. In each round of play, each player rolls all the dice.
5. If the result of the roll is a PRIME number, the player has the opporunity to add to their robot by rolling the 6-sided die.
6. Each piece of the robot is numbered 1-6. The roll of the 6-sided die determines which piece the player adds to their robot. If the player already has that piece, nothing is added and their opponent takes a turn.
